# About

The PUB is the public-facing website that materializes a Power Water Communities DSP instance and provides the various information, communication, engagement and participation capabilities in a user-friendly web portal, publishing project data and interacting with the project’s intended audience. All the content of the PUB  is managed by the HUB backend.

For details about the PUB software's specific design and implementation, please check the included documentation (pdf).

# Background

The Power Water Communities DSP open-source software repository was created and is curated by the Power (Political and social awareness on water environmental challenges) Project and its partners, with development led by Baseform. The Digital Social Platform (DSP) is the project’s main tool to be made available to cities, utilities, public agencies or water-related interest groups, aiming at an active and relevant contribution to the creation of digital communities around themes specifically related to water and the quality of life of local populations. 

Such DSPs are typically aimed at community members, activists, volunteers, municipal officials and representatives, water professionals and experts, as well as regional, national or international-level policy-makers, politicians and other stakeholders. A specific instance of the DSP is made available through a dedicated Water Community website and an accompanying mobile app, designed to fulfill both informative, engagement and participatory roles. 

The Power Water Communities DSP includes three related but separate software repositories: HUB, a content management back-end; PUB, the web front-end for the general public; and MOB, its mobile app counterpart.   

POWER is a Research and Innovation Action, supporting the EIP Water Action Group, NetwercH2O and City Blueprints. It is funded by the European Commission under the H2020 Programme, Call ICT10-2015 ‘Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation’ - Topic c) Digital Social Platforms (DSP).
